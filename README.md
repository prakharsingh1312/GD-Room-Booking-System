## phpMyReservation

phpMyReservation is a web-based reservation and booking system.

It was originally written to replace the paper-based reservation system used to reserve a common washing machine. Since it has other potential uses, and can be useful to others, I decided to make it available here.

It can for example be used to reserve a tennis court, a conference/meeting room etc. It is not intented to be used in situations where high security, high reliability or being able to handle hundreds of users is required.

### !!! This project is currently not maintained !!!

Many are contacting me regarding a new version. As of now I can not guarantee a new version in the near future. I will keep all your suggestions in mind if I start working on a new version. I am aware of that this version has some bugs, flaws and not the best code. Feel free to fork and improve it! This was written when I was still learning to program web-based apps. It is pretty stable and works well in many conditions, though.
